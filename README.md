# mario-harvardCS50
This is the first of many problem sets in Harvard's CS50 course.

This program takes in a user-specified "height", between 0 and 23, and creates a half-pyramid of said height, just like the one's Mario used to jump over
  in the old Nintendo games. The pyramid is printed in the terminal.
